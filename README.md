## How to build and run app locally
1. Install expo-cli
2. Open project on your favorite IDE
3. Run `npm install` on terminal, 
    if this doesn't work, then run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
4. Run `npm start` 
5. Open on your emulator, 
    or, if you prefer to open on your phone, then open the metro bundler on http://localhost:19000 or whatever link stated on the terminal. Usually, "Developer tools running on http://localhost:19002"

    Then, set connection to tunnel and wait until tunnel ready. Scan the code on your terminal or on the metro bundler.
6. Done!
