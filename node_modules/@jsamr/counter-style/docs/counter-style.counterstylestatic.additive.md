## CounterStyleStatic.additive property

Create an additive system renderer.

See [CSS Counter Styles Level 3, Accumulating Numerals: the additive system](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-counter-styles-3/#additive-system)<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
additive: (symbols: Record<number, string>) => CounterStyleRenderer;
```

## Remarks

Additive systems might have "holes" in their range coverage. For example, an additive system which has no representation for "1" will not translate odd indexes. \*\*The behavior of this renderer for incomplete additive systems is unspecified.\*\*
